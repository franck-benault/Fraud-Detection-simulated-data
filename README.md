# Fraud-Detection-simulated-data
Fraud transactions detection based on simulated data (Python)

Using the input files https://github.com/Fraud-Detection-Handbook (folder transformed)
I try to use classical learning machine algorithm to predict the fraud

# Sampling
The issue is that for fraud detection the date are extremely imbalanced.
The fraud rate is lower than 0.1%.
Sampling techniques are techniques trying to reduce the imbalanced by removing records from the majority class or adding records to the minority class.

## Undersampling
### Random undersampling

## Oversampling
### Random oversampling
